after writing down docker-compose.yml file
run:
1)docker-compose up -d in one terminal
port for kafka ui:http://localhost:8080/
2) run py consumer.py in a separate terminal
3)run py producer.py in another terminal
and watch as the message from producer appears on the consumer.py terminal

u can also start consumers in many terminals at the same time 
when the second consumer gets connected, rebalance happens which is implemented by
zookeeper
after rebalance one consumer will be responsible for one particular partition that nobody else is
responsible for and etc

that is done so that 2 consumers wont be reading 1 message 2 times or more
