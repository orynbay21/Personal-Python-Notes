after writing down docker-compose.yml file
run:
1)docker-compose up -d in one terminal
port for kafka ui:http://localhost:8080/
2) run py consumer.py in a separate terminal
3)run py producer.py in another terminal
and watch as the message from producer appears on the consumer.py terminal

u can also start consumers in many terminals at the same time
